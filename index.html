            <p>I was born in Tiraspol, Moldova. In 2007, I came to the Unites States. A few years later I became a United States citizen.
            </p>
            <p> I received my Bachelor’s degree in Accounting from Central Washington University in 2010, and I got my Master’s degree in Accounting - Taxation from University of Washington. In 2015 I received my first CPA license. My working experience consists of more than 7 years in different areas of accounting such as auditing, taxation, and private industry accounting.

                When I was working as a Senior Accountant, I had a lot projects for which I had to run a variety of different reports. Since the company was a mid-size, there was a big database. I started using Excel filters and macros. After a while, I noticed that this kind of work excites me very much. So, I made a big decision to switch from accounting to programming. <br><br>
